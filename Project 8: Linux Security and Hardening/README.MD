### Basic Commands for Linux

<details>
<summary>ls</summary><br><b>

The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder with a GUI, the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default, and further interact with them via the command line.

<summary>cd</summary><br><b>

The cd command will allow you to change directories. ... To navigate into the root directory, use "cd /" To navigate to your home directory, use "cd" or "cd ~" To navigate up one directory level, use "cd .." To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use "cd -"

<details>
<summary>mkdir</summary><br><b>

The mkdir command in the Unix, DOS, DR FlexOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows, and ReactOS operating systems is used to make a new directory.

<details>
<summary>touch</summary><br><b>

The touch command is a command line utility to update timestamps on files. UNIX and UNIX like operating systems store timestamp information for each file or folder including access time, modify time and change time. It is possible to modify timestamps using the touch command either to update a timestamp to the current time or to modify it to a date in the past.

<summary>cp</summary><br><b>

cp stands for copy. This command is used to copy files or group of files or directory. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with different file name. cp command require at least two filenames in its arguments.

<summary>mv</summary><br><b>

The mv command (short from move) is used to rename and move and files and directories from one location to another. 
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>rm</summary><br><b>

rm stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on from the file system like UNIX. To be more precise, rm removes references to objects from the filesystem, where those objects might have had multiple references (for example, a file with two different names). By default, it does not remove directories.
